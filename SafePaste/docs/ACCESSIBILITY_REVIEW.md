| Check | Method | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Textarea has associated label | Automated static HTML check | PASS | `Original text` and `Sanitized text` labels target matching textarea IDs. |
| Buttons have understandable text | Automated static HTML check | PASS | Buttons use visible text: `Sanitize`, `Copy sanitized text`, and `Clear`. |
| Checkbox has associated label | Automated static HTML check | PASS | IPv4 checkbox is wrapped in a label with descriptive text. |
| Semantic HTML is used | Automated static HTML check | PASS | Page includes `header`, `main`, `section`, and heading structure. |
| Keyboard focus is visible | Automated static CSS check | PASS | CSS defines `:focus-visible` outline for buttons, textareas, and inputs. |
| Controls use keyboard-operable elements | Automated static HTML check | PASS | Controls are native `button`, `textarea`, and checkbox input elements. |
| Controls are reachable by keyboard | Human browser/manual check required | NOT VERIFIED | Manual check: load the page in a browser and use Tab/Shift+Tab through every control. |
| Logical tab order | Human browser/manual check required | NOT VERIFIED | Manual check: verify focus moves through input, output, toggle, buttons, and summary in a sensible order. |
| No important information relies only on color | Automated static text/CSS review | PASS | Status messages, redaction count, button labels, and category text communicate state in text. |
| Disabled Copy state is understandable | Automated static HTML and product behavior harness | PASS | Copy button starts disabled and is labeled `Copy sanitized text`; product behavior harness verifies it disables after Clear. |
| Status/result messages are understandable | Automated static HTML and product behavior harness | PASS | Initial, sanitize, copy, and clear status messages are text-based and understandable. |
| Screen reader announcement quality | Human assistive-technology check required | NOT VERIFIED | Manual check: use a screen reader to confirm the polite live-region updates are announced as expected. |

Conclusion:
All accessibility checks that can be automated locally passed. Browser keyboard traversal and screen-reader announcement quality remain NOT VERIFIED because they require a real browser/assistive-technology pass.
